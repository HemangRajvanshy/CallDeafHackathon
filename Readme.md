Are you or a friend blind or have unreliable internet? Then this cell based hack for financial info is just for you.

## Inspiration
The biggest barrier to personal finance is knowledge. This prompted us to convey financial information through calling, completely accessible from a wired phone without even a screen. 

## What it does
This application is completely accessible through a phone call. Without the need of an internet connection, keep up to date with your favorite stock (and options) with this pleasant voice bot!

## How we built it
The call platform was built using Twilio. Flask was used in conjunction with it to send HTTP data from the local server to call platform. Python was used to query and process data from various APIs, such as Yahoo Finance and Aladdin.
